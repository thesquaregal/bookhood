# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

I was supposed to be finished but then I realised that I didn't set up my grids correctly for my intended layout. I also noticed that on mobile, some containers would be larger than the header + caused an unappealing overflow which was not what I wanted. It didn't have the margins I was hoping it would have for larger screens so I had to re-structure my code again.
