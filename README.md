# Bookhood üìöüêõ - IXXN 221 Web Design I

It took some time to get familiar with setting up the correct grid system which would be scalable across all of my 8 pages. I re-structured my code a few times to see what worked the best. However, it's difficult to fully know how responsive the website is in screens bigger than mine but hopefully, I've set up an effective 12-grid system. I also experimented with units like rem, em, vh and vw to see which ones would be the most appropriate to use in padding, margins and fonts. I really wanted to utilise units which would be relative according to different screen sizes. Generally, I used rem for font sizes and em for paddings and margins. I also ran into some overflow issues especially when scaling down to mobile which meant I had to re-structure my HTML code. Another thing I noticed was that if I downloaded the file thru github, the relative path wasn't being recognised. I thought this might be because I've put my files into different folders. To solve for this issue, I used '../' whenever I needed to link to a file within a folder. 

For this project, I focused a lot on layout however in the future, I would like to incorporate more fun elements which would create a more fun and delightful experience. I could also look into adding in animations with CSS or javascript. Overall, I'm happy with the final output. I learnt a lot about how to overcome a variety of layout challenges using CSS grids which was a very valuable experience.
