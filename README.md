# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

I've finished translating the landing page design into code. One of the main challenges was to tackle the overlapping elements in the desktop version while also, still making sure it is adapts nicely as the screen size shrinks. I used z-index and absolute position to solve this problem. I've managed to get the landing page to look exactly like the one in the Figma prototype so I'm happy about. I've also updated the design in my setup page and incorporated animated lottie files from https://lottiefiles.com/jnb8yvcvas3md0g3. Overall, I've managed to translate all my Figma pages into a responsive site using HTML and CSS. I just need to clean up my code and should just be ready to hand-in!
