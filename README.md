# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

I've finished coding all the pages I've designed on Figma. I've also re-structured my code and followed a mobile-first approach. I felt like this made things a lot faster than how I did it previously with the span approach so I'm glad that I decided to take the time to re-structure my code. I'm happy with the layout so far but I'm still going to try incorporate the grid areas especially as I move on to the larger screen sizes. I feel like this would be useful as I need to incorporate more complicated grids.
