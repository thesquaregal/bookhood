# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

I've translated my webpages from a Figma prototype into a Responsive website using HTML and CSS. I relied on the style guide I set up from the previous project in terms of typography and layout. I've set up 3 different reponsive grid systems thru CSS to meet the needs of my design. I used media queries to ensure that the layout is still effective as the screen size shrinks. I also relied heavily on the units 'vh' and 'vw' to ensure my designs adapted to different viewport sizes as effectively as possible. I also used z-index and absolute position to achieve the overlapping elements I had on my landing page as well as the sticky position to get the navigation bar to stick to the top on scroll. As advised, I designed from a mobile-first approach and worked my way up to the desktop version. Following this approach as well as establishing a style guide from the previous project saved me a lot of time translating my designs into code. Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this project turned out! It was the first time I really got to not only design but also, code my own website. It taught me a lot about the kinds of constraints I would need to think about when I need to translate design into code. I learnt a lot about and got comfortable working with HTML and CSS.
