# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

So far, I've coded 5 out of 8 of the pages I've designed on Figma. I used a span approach but this was not recommended so, I think for my next step, I'll do some re-structuring to organise my code a little better by using grid areas. 

Here's what my pages look like on Figma

Here's a preview of what I've coded so far

The main additions to my website as I started coding was a sticky navigation bar that sticks to the top of the webpage as you scroll. Another thing I added was that I discovered Lottie Files from another course and I thought it was really cool so I decided to incorporate it into my design.
