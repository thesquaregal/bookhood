# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

I've finished adapting the design for different screen sizes in code. I've adapted different grid systems depending on the needs of my layout. I've also figured out how to keep one side of the column fixed on scroll in the expanded book title which I was happy about. At the moment, the website is fully responsive. However, I still need to work on the landing page and make sure it's as close as possiible to my Figma prototype.
