# Bookhood - Web Design I 2022

So far, I've coded 5 out of 8 of the pages I've designed on Figma. I used a span approach but this was not recommended so, I think for my next step, I'll do some re-structuring to organise my code a little better by using grid areas. 

Here's what my pages look like on Figma
